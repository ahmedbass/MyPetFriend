# MyPetFriend

This is my graduation project.
MyPetFriend is an android application that facilitates the pet care process for the pet owner.
This application has 4 main goals:
   1. agenda for the pet with a reminder with all the activities the pet has.
   2. an open market to allow users to offer pets/pet items for sale online.
   3. forum-like open discussions for issues that might face the pet owners with their pets.
   4. displaying the pet-related places around the user based on their location.
