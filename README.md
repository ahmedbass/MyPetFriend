# MyPetFriend

This is my graduation project.
MyPetFriend is an android application that facilitates the pet care process for the pet owner.
It has two actors (pet owner & pet care provider).
This application has 4 main goals:
   1. agenda for the pet with a reminder with all the activities the pet has.
   2. an open market to allow users to offer pets/pet items for sale online.
   3. displaying the pet-related places around the user based on their location.
   4. pet owners can view the pet care providers who also registered in the app,
      while pet care providers can view the pet owners requests for pet care.
