---FIRST WEEK---
I made the style of the app and worked on design. 
I created a simple drawable file for icons background.
I created some of the app's activities. 
the app doesn't have any functionality at this point (except for moving between activities, and contacting the advertiser in one of the activities).

---SECOND WEEK---
I added registration and login activities (without functionality yet) and "forgot your password" activity that sends an email to the user's email with their password.
I made some modifications on various parts of my design from my previous commit.
I made a change in the plan of my application goal: instead of having a veterinarian actor, it will be pet care provider for broader benefit for both, pet owners and for people who are looking for pet care jobs.

---THIRD WEEK---
I created few more activities (welcome first screen, pet care services list, pet care provider's profile). yet the application still doesn't have any functionality.
I created one class to hold the pet care provider objects, but it may need some updates.
I also added the logo of my application.
